    <p class="brief">A series of paintings to explore colourful characteristics, unique to the city of Lisbon. How does
      colour
      contribute to Lisbon’s cultural identity, enhance atmosphere, and influence social behaviour within the
      streetscape?</p>
    <br>
    <p><q>A distinctive local pallet, which contributes to a strong sense of place, can engender a correspondingly
        strong sense of belonging for members of a community</q>

    <p><q>Travelers meet colourful characters, witness colourful events and visit colourful places. In these
        expressions, the meaning of colourful is partially literal and partially metaphorical.</q>

      <p>The street artist is the storyteller, engaging passers by. Communication through colour
        and casual interaction. Street art creates ownership of the streetscape by its inhabitants through personal
        embellishment of the public realm.</p>
      <p><q>Some colours acquired symbolic meaning to meet a community’s need for communication.</q>

      <p>Captivated by expansive views across Lisbon, people congregate at viewing sites throughout the landscape to
        marvel over the characteristic, terracotta roofscape. Whether to draw out a camera, or to simply sit and take in
        the breath-taking scenery, the calming tones of the rooves makes people stop, look and listen, and appreciate
        the colourful city.</p>

      <p>Rua Nova do Carvalho - a colourful arena with a colourful history. As the vibrant flower attracts the bee, the
        dynamic hues of the urban realm, attract a buzzing crowd. Seduced by the alluring pavement, flocks of people are
        immersed in the narrative of the space. At one time in history, a meeting point for sailors, criminals and
        prostitutes in the heart of the red light district. Today, the neighbourhood’s atmosphere and reputation have
        been completely revolutionised. Fishing nets and the scandalous pink colour remain and provoke memories of the
        past.</p>

      <p>Colourful pigments plastering the facades, frame the cool limestone pavement in pastel shades of mint, salmon,
        and yellow. Below is movement, hustle and bustle, as people gather to board bright orange vintage trams, enticed
        to explore deeper into the city.</p>
      <p><q>Colours can help us find our way. Colours can affect how we feel in a place, and that in turn, can give us
          some insight into the character of the inhabitants.</q><span class="quoter">(Cugley and Green-Armytage

      <p>At night, the glowing garlands illuminate the otherwise cold and narrow back street to create an enchanting,
        kaleidoscopic street fiesta. An incandescent social place, inviting locals and travellers alike to enjoy food,
        music, and family. The colours of the carnival, bright tassels and bunting above pathways adorn the streetscape,
        making everyday a reason to celebrate.</p>
